# Redisearch-Digital-Banking-redisson

Provides a quick-start example of using Redis with springBoot and redisson with Banking structures.  Digital Banking uses an API microservices approach to enable high speed requests for account, customer and transaction information.  As seen below, this data is useful for a variety of business purposes in the bank.

### Note:  This is the same as Redisearch-Digital-Banking but uses redisson redistemplate instead of any of the crudrepository indexes.  redisearch 2.0 indexes will be used.  This is not using the crudrepository for the basic redis data. 

## Overview
In this tutorial, a java spring boot application is run through a jar file to support typical API calls to a REDIS banking data layer.  A redis docker configuration is included.

## Redis Advantages for Digital Banking
 * Redis easily handles high write transaction volume
 * Redis has no tombstone issues and can upsert posted transactions over pending
 * Redis Enterprise scales vertically (large nodes)  and horizontally (many nodes)
 * Redisearch 2.0 automatically indexes the hash structure created by Spring Java CRUD repository

## Requirements
* Docker installed on your local system, see [Docker Installation Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
* Alternatively, can run Redis Enterprise and set the redis host and port in the application.properties file
* When using Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows, the default resources allocated to the linux VM running docker are 2GB RAM and 2 CPU's. Make sure to adjust these resources to meet the resource requirements for the containers you will be running. More information can be found here on adjusting the resources allocated to docker.

## Technical Overview

This github java code uses the redisson java library with spring boot starter for redis.   

### The spring java code
This is basic spring links
* [Spring Redis](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-redis/docs/current/reference/html/#redis.repositories.indexes)
* *config*-Initial configuration module using autoconfiguration and a threadpool sizing to adjust based on machine size
* *controller*-http API call interfaces
* *data*-code to generate POC type of customer, account, and transaction code
* *domain*-has each of the java objects with their columns.  Enables all the getter/setter methods
* *repository*-This is repository layer
* *service*-asyncservice and bankservice doing the interaction with redis
### 
The java code demonstrates common API actions with the data layer in REDIS.  The java spring Boot framework minimizes the amount of code to build and maintain this solution.  Maven is used to build the java code and the code is deployed to the tomcat server.

## Getting Started using Docker desktop
1. Prepare Docker environment-see the Prerequisites section above...
2. Pull this github into a directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jphaugla/Redisearch-Digital-Banking.git
```
3. Refer to the notes for redis Docker images used but don't get too bogged down as docker compose handles everything except for a few admin steps on tomcat.
 * [https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/redis/](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/redis/)  
4. Open terminal and change to the github home where you will see the docker-compose.yml file, then: 
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Getting Started without Docker on ubuntu

This docker compose will build the docker image for the java application and deploy it to docker.  The following steps are if you want to run on a separate environment without docker.  To do this, comment out the bankapp from the docker image

1. Install maven and java
```bash
sudo apt-get install maven
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
```
1. Pull this github into a directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jphaugla/Redisearch-Digital-Banking.git
```
1. edit ./src/main/resources/application.properties to change the redis host and the redis port number 

## Execute sample application 

1. Compile the code
```bash
mvn package
```
2.  run the jar file.   
```bash
java -jar target/redis-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
3.  Test the application from a separate terminal window.  This script uses an API call to generate sample banking customers, accounts and transactions.  It uses Spring ASYNC techniques to generate higher load.  A flag chooses between running the transactions pipelined in Redis or in normal non-pipelined method.
```bash
./scripts/generateData.sh
```
Shows a benchmark test run of  generateData.sh on GCP servers.  Although, this test run is using redisearch 1.0 code base.  Need to rerun this test.

4.  Investigate the APIs in ./scripts.  Adding the redisearch queries behind each script here also...
  * addTag.sh - add a tag to a transaction.  Tags allow user to mark  transactions to be in a buckets such as Travel or Food for budgetary tracking purposes
  * deleteCustomer.sh - delete all customers matching a string
  * generateData.sh - simple API to generate default customer, accounts, merchants, phone numbers, emails and transactions
  * generateLots.sh - for server testing to generate higher load levels.  Use with startAppservers.sh.  Not for use with docker setup.  This is load testing with redis enterprise and client application running in same network in the cloud.
  * getByAccount.sh - find transactions for an account between a date range
  * getByCreditCard.sh - find transactions for a credit card  between a date range
  * getByCustID.sh - retrieve transactions for customer
  * getByEmail.sh - retrieve customer record using email address
  * getByMerchant.sh - find all transactions for an account from one merchant for date range
  * getByMerchantCategory.sh - find all transactions for an account from merchant category for date range
  * getByNamePhone.sh - get customers by phone and full name.
  * getByPhone.sh - get customers by phone only
  * getByStateCity.sh - get customers by city and state
  * getByZipLastname.sh -  get customers by zipcode and lastname.
  * getReturns.sh - get returned transactions count by reason code
  * getTags.sh - get all tags on an account
  * getTaggedAccountTransactions.sh - find transactions for an account with a particular tag
  * getTransaction.sh - get one transaction by its transaction ID
  * getTransactionStatus.sh - see count of transactions by account status of PENDING, AUTHORIZED, SETTLED
  * putCustomer.sh - put a set of json customer records
  * saveAccount.sh - save a sample account
  * saveCustomer.sh - save a sample customer
  * saveTransaction.sh - save a sample Transaction
  * startAppservers.sh - start multiple app server instances for load testing
  * testPipeline.sh - test pipelining
  * updateTransactionStatus.sh - generate new transactions to move all transactions from one transaction Status up to the next transaction status. Parameter is target status.  Can choose SETTLED or POSTED.  Will move 100,000 transactions per call
